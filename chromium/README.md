### Usage guide
#### General notes:
- If something isn't working, try to restart the page. If it didn't help, create an issues on GitHub repo, or contact me about issue in Discord: @sinskiy_
- Extention works only on pages, that contain */vgp/*, */fl/* or */ in their url

This extensions adds following features for Seterra:
- **No label**. When enabled, you don't have label with the name of the country you need to click and flag of that country.

    **Notes**:
    - To return your label you either need to finish your quiz or restart the page.
    - Can't be enabled when dark label is enabled

    <br/>

- **No corner flag**. When enabled, flag in the top right corner of the quiz is invisible

- **Dark label**. When enabled, background of label with the name of the country you need to click and flag of that country turns dark, and text on the label turns white.

    **Notes**:
    - Can't be enabled when no label is enabled

    <br/>

- **Dark quiz header**. When enabled, header of the current quiz (that thing on the top of the quiz that displays the timer and more) turns dark

- **Darkmode**. When enabled, background turns dark, and color turns white (actually there were a lot of small issues to fix, so that's not as simple as sounds)

- **Water**. You can choose your own water color. Whene reset button is clicked, resets to standart value
